# Smart File Intelligence System — Created by Shivam Chaurasia

**Project type:** Run-ready automation / workflow  
**Author:** Shivam Chaurasia  
**Purpose:** This project automates the intake, processing, and summarization of different file types (TXT, CSV, PDF) placed in an `input/` folder. It extracts text, cleans it, categorizes files by content type, generates summary reports, and stores outputs in `output/`. The system is modular, easy to run, and demonstrates real-world automation skills.

## Features
- Detects file types: `.txt`, `.csv`, `.pdf` (PDF support optional)
- Extracts and cleans text from each file
- Generates per-file summaries (word count, line count, top keywords)
- Saves cleaned text into `output/cleaned/`
- Saves per-file JSON metadata into `output/meta/`
- Creates a daily aggregated report `output/report.txt`
- Logs all steps into `output/log.txt`
- Configurable via `config.json`

## Why this project stands out
- Real-world workflow that mimics corporate automation pipelines
- Modular and well-documented code suitable for recruiters to review
- Minimal dependencies; PDF support is optional (PyPDF2)
- Designed to be uploaded to GitHub as a strong portfolio item

## How to run (very simple)
1. Extract the repository folder.
2. Put files you want processed into the `input/` folder (sample files are provided).
3. (Optional) Install PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction:
   ```
   pip install PyPDF2
   ```
4. Run:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
5. Check results in `output/`:
   - `output/cleaned/` : cleaned text files
   - `output/meta/` : JSON metadata per file
   - `output/log.txt` : step-by-step log
   - `output/report.txt` : aggregated summary report

## Repository name suggestion
`Smart_File_Intelligence_By_Sshivam` or `Smart_File_Intelligence_Shivam`

## Files included
- `main.py` : main orchestrator
- `utils.py` : helper functions for extraction and cleaning
- `config.json` : user settings (file types, keywords)
- `input/` : sample input files (sample1.txt, sample2.csv)
- `output/` : generated after running
- `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## How this matches my profile
This project demonstrates skills listed on my resume: Python automation, ETL-style processing, workflow orchestration, logging, and report generation. It is built to be readable, maintainable, and directly usable in prescreen tests and recruiter reviews.
